The source is an experiment in using [rxjava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) to interface with webservices and ui event notification. It also:

* leverages [retrofit](square.github.io/retrofit/) (with a custom OAuth Consumer) to make api calls to Yelp's search interface
* [dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/) dependency injection
* [robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) tests
* [picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) for image downloads
* [retrolambda](http://retrolambda.com) retrolambda for java lamda
support on android!
